# ‚úçÔ∏è Generative Text Model

This repository features an interactive implementation of a **Generative Text Model** built with deep learning in Python using TensorFlow and Keras. The notebook demonstrates how Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers, can learn textual patterns from a dataset and generate original sequences of text that mimic the style and structure of the input.

The project serves as a practical introduction to sequence modeling and creative natural language generation, making it ideal for students, researchers, and AI enthusiasts.

## üß† How It Works

This project follows a standard pipeline for character-based text generation:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:

   * A plain text file is loaded and cleaned (lowercased, stripped of unwanted characters).
   * A character mapping is created to encode text into sequences of integers.
   * Training sequences are generated by sliding a window across the text and predicting the next character from a given sequence.

2. **Model Architecture**:

   * The model is built using Keras Sequential API with:

     * An **Embedding layer** (optional, depending on word/char-level modeling).
     * One or more **LSTM layers** for sequence memory.
     * A **Dense layer** with softmax activation to predict the next character.
   * The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.

3. **Training**:

   * The model is trained on thousands of character sequences, learning to predict the next character based on the previous ones.
   * Training continues over several epochs until the loss converges.

4. **Text Generation**:

   * A seed string is provided as input.
   * The model generates a specified number of characters by predicting one at a time and feeding each back as input.
   * The result is a stylized output that resembles the training corpus.

## üì¶ Requirements

Install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy keras
```

You will also need a plain `.txt` file as your training data. Examples include:

* Classic literature (Shakespeare, Poe)
* Movie scripts
* Song lyrics
* Scientific papers or articles

## üìå Sample Output

After training on a sample corpus of English literature, here‚Äôs a snippet generated by the model:

```
Seed: "the night was dark and"

Generated:
"the night was dark and the silence fell upon the forest. the shadows drifted by the trees as if the wind were whispering a forgotten tale of time. in the heart of it all, a flame still burned, waiting..."
```

The model learns to replicate grammar, word usage, and stylistic cues, producing impressively coherent text after sufficient training.

## üéØ Use Cases

* Creative writing tools (poems, lyrics, stories)
* Auto-suggestion for text editors
* AI-generated literature or chatbot backends
* Educational demos of NLP and sequence modeling

---

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

* Add **temperature control** to regulate creativity and randomness in output.
* Support **word-level generation** for more semantic accuracy.
* Introduce **bidirectional LSTMs** or **transformers** for improved context retention.
* Save and reload models using `model.save()` and `load_model()`.
